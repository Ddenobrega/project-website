      </h1>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Techshop Inc. (the "Company", "we",
        "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information in
        connection with your use of our website, mobile application, or services
        (collectively, the "Services").
      </p>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <span>We collect two types of information about users</span>
      <p>
        Personal Information: This is information that can be used to identify
        you as an individual, such as your name, email address, phone number, or
        mailing address. You will only be asked to provide personal information
        when necessary to use specific features of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Personal Information: This is information that does not identify you
        as an individual, such as your browser type, operating system, IP
        address, browsing activity, and usage data. We may collect non-personal
        information automatically when you use the Services.
      </p>
      <h2>Use of Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Services</li>
        <li>Improve the Services</li>
        <li>
          Send you informational emails or marketing communications (with your
          consent)
        </li>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries and requests</li>
        <li>
          For any other purpose disclosed to you at the time of collection
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may disclose your information to third-party service providers who
        help us operate the Services. These service providers are obligated to
        keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes we
        have disclosed to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also disclose your information if we are required to do so by law
        or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply
        with a court order, subpoena, or other legal process.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We will retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the
        Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
        enforce our agreements.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <span>You have certain choices regarding your information:</span>
      <p>
        You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us by
        following the unsubscribe instructions in those communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access and update your personal information through your account
        settings.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized
        access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet
        transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot
        guarantee the security of your information.
      </p>
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
        are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided
        us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that
        we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will
        take steps to delete that information.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
